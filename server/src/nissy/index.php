            I have decided to shut down Web Nissy.
            Thank you to everyone who gave feedback, especially my friends in the FMC discord server.
            I still love FMC!
        </p>

            Web Nissy was only about 2% of the traffic on cubingapp, but required most of the server cost.
            Is is no longer sustainable for me to host Web Nissy.

            It's a great tool for EO, DR, and HTR.
            The code for Web Nissy has been and will remain on <a href="https://github.com/spencerchubb/nissy" class="link">github</a>.
